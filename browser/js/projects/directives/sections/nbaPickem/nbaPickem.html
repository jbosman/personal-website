				This is a personal site I made for a group of my friends to track a new type of fantasy basketball league we wanted to try this year. Instead of drafting players, each person drafts NBA teams. The site was brought to life for the purpose of my friends being able to track their progress over the course of the season. The number of wins for each set of drafted teams is summed and whoever has the most at the end of the season wins.

				This project was really fun to put together because it involved two things very close to my heart: my friends and basketball. The site scrapes the ESPN website to update the number of wins for each NBA team. I was experimenting with what would be the best method to update the number of wins for NBA teams and settled on live updating the page client side every 60 seconds.
