				This is a website I created while doing the projects on freecodecamp.com. This was a lot of fun to work on since I was really able to start utilizing the html and css that I had been studying at the time. Working on this project gave me a solid foundation in understanding how to position elements using css.

				This was my first React application and it gave me a lot of insight in understanding the benefits of React components. The app uses the html5 geolocation api for getting the user's latitude and longitude, the dark sky weather api for weather data, and the google maps api for reverse geolocating the latitude and longitude into a human decipherable location.
