				ImVue is an Android mobile application that allows users to save text and images (projects) with geo-location and tilt data. Other users are then able to view previously created projects only in the geo-location range and tilt range that the original project was saved with.  This was mine, Jose, Han, and Danny's final capstone project. We had a great time working on the project and hope you'll try out our app on heroku!
