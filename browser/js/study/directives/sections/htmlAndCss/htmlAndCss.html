	<h2>HTML and CSS: Design and Building Website</h2>
	<h3>Instructor: John Duckett</h3>
	<p>
		This book I found after searching for recommended web developer books. John Duckett covers a lot HTML and CSS in this book and I'm sure I'll be referencing it for the rest of my career. The book is beautiful and you can tell John has a lot of experience using CSS to make website beautiful.
