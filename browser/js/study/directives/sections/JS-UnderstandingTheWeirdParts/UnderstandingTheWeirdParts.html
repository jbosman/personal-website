	<h2>JS: Understanding the Weird Parts</h2>
	<h3>Instructor: Anthony Alicea</h3>
	<p>
		This course was great follow up to Kyle Simpson's You Don't Know JS series. It covers some of the same topics, but Anthony provides some great visuals and simple examples to follow along with while he's explaining concepts. I took this to continue my pursuit of becoming a master of the JS language.
