	<h2>Learn and Understand NodeJS</h2>
	<h3>Instructor: Anthony Alicea</h3>
	<p>
		I took this course after having a general understanding of how to use NodeJS. It allowed me to reinforce what I already knew and also provided more detail on other things that I didn't. I wanted to take this to continue sharpening my skills as a fullstack developer.
