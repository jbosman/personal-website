	<h2>Learn and Understand AngularJS</h2>
	<h3>Instructor: Anthony Alicea</h3>
	<p>
		I took this course after having a general understanding of how to use AngularJS. It allowed me to reinforce what I already knew and also provided more detail on other things that I didn't. Anthony is a great instructor on Udemy and as you can see, I also took a few of his other courses.
