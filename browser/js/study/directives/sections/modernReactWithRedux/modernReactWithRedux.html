	<h2>Modern React With Redux</h2>
	<h3>Instructor: Stephen Grider</h3>
	<p>
		This course was my introduction to using React. I really enjoyed learning how to use React and it was nice to see a different framework after learning AngularJS. This course is also great because Stephen uses Webpack which gives you a little bit of intro to using it. Stephen does a great job teaching and I've queued up a few more of his courses to take.
