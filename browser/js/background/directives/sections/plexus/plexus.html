				<p>
				Plexus was my first job out of school where I worked my way up to a senior test engineer.  My job responsibilities included quoting, designing, constructing, programming, verifying, and installing test systems in Plexus Manufacturing sites located in Chicago, IL, San Jose, CA, and Penang, Malaysia. I'm very thankful to have worked at such a great company and to have met so many great people a long the way.
