				I attended Fullstack Academy to launch my career in web development and couldn't be happier with the choice. The program was challenging and a huge commentment of both time and money, but it was well worth it. I added an additional programming language (Javascript) to my tool belt and, more importantly, found a career I'm passionate about, can help others with, and that will satisfy my thirst for continually learning new things.

				<p>
				The stack I learned at Fullstack included PostgreSQL, Express, and Angular JS 1. In addition to these I learned NodeJS, Gulp, SaSS, and Git. I also learned a great deal about working on projects in teams, as well as the benefits of pair programming. See the <a ui-sref='projects'>Projects</a> page to see some of the projects I helped to create at Fullstack.

				 ImVue is an Android phone application that allows users to draw pictures, leave messages, and insert images taged to certain geolocations for other users to view.
				 This was my final project at Fullstack done in collaboration with Danny Kearney, Han Cho, and Jose Riveria.

				The following is a tech talk I did at fullstack that explains why it's called pass by sharing rather than pass by reference with Javascript.

				I attended fullstack academy to launch my career in web development and couldn't be happier with the choice. The program was challenging and a huge commentment of both time and money, but it was well worth it. The instructors do a great job of teaching high-level <abbr title='Computer Science'>CS</abbr> concepts, the history of web technologies, and whatever is on the forefront for a fullstack technologies. The atmosphere is also great to learn in as you are surrounded by like minded indivuals that are just as dedicated to learning a new set of skills as you.
				</p>
				<p>
				The stack my cohort learned while I was there included programming in Javascript with PostgreSQL, Express, and AngularJS 1. By the time we were in our senior phase of the program they had switched the cohort behind us from Angular to React. Which shows their commitment to teaching the hottest technologies

			<div class='col-12'><h3>Program Overview</h3></div>
		
			<div class='col-12'><h4>Foundations (4 weeks)</h4></div>
			<div class='col-12'><h5>Remote Bootstrap Javascript, HTML, CSS Skills</h5></div>
			<div class='col-10'>
				<p>
				After being accepted into the program you spend 4 weeks before arriving on campus learning the basics of Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This is in preperation for the entrance exam that you take your first week at fullstack. This is done to make sure everyone has a base set of skills before begining the on-campus portion and also to make sure students are ready for the 13-week commitment they're about to embark on.

			<div class='col-12'><h4>Core Curriculum (7 weeks)</h4></div>
			<div class='col-12'><h5>Fullstack Applications</h5></div>
			<div class='col-10'>
				<p>
				The core curriculum consists of attending classes Mon-Sat, 9am - 7pm, where you learn about CS concepts, the history of web technologies, and how to build fullstack applications. The days consist of lectures from the instructors and then pair programming labs with different partners to enforce the concepts.
				</p>

			<div class='col-12'><h4>Senior Phase (6 weeks)</h4></div>
			<div class='col-12'><h5>Projects!</h5></div>
			<div class='col-10'>
				<p>
				The senior phase consists of doing a tech talk, 3 projects, and preparing for the job search. The tech talk is a presentation on a topic of your choice to your cohort. This is done both to expose everyone to new technologies and also a chance for students to learn something on their own and work on presentation skills. The first of 3 projects is an e-commerce site done in a group of 3-4 over the course of a week. Next an individual (or pair) project completed in 3-4 days. Then finally you do a capstone project in a group of 3-4 for 2-3 weeks which culminates with presenting your project to employers at the end of the program. You'll also be setup with 2 quick on-campus interiews (~10 mins) to meet potential employers and expose you to a taste of the interview process. Through out the senior phase you also work on your resume, linkedIn profile, and technical interiew questions.
